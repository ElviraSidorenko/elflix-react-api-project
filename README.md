# Elflix - Your Movie Information Hub

Elflix is a web application built with React that provides users with comprehensive information about movies. It leverages the OMDb API (Open Movie Database) to fetch and display data about thousands of movies. Whether you're a movie enthusiast, a casual viewer, or just looking for something new to watch, Elflix has got you covered.

## Technologies Used

**React:** The front-end of Elflix is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
